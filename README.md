# scrapper
A web scrapper made by using puppeteer with node.js

It can save a full page screenshot of any webpage you wish to save to your local storage, storing under a unique name.

It also has a commented-out part which can be used to target a specific DOM node to only screenshot that part of the page.
  However, there is a hard-coded limit on Chromium webpage height, which can be by-passed by opting for a full page screenshot.
